# Clean Code Principles

## Simplicity
- Keep the code as simple as possible.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
- Focus on solving the problem at hand without adding extra features.

## Readability
- Write code that is easy to understand for others and your future self.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add comments where necessary, but let the code itself be self-explanatory.

## Maintainability
- Ensure the code is easy to modify and extend in the future.
- Use modular design and avoid tightly coupled components.
- Write tests to verify functionality and prevent regressions.

## Consistency
- Follow established style guides and project conventions.
- Maintain uniform formatting, naming conventions, and structure throughout the codebase.
- Consistency reduces cognitive load and makes collaboration easier.

## Efficiency
- Write performant and optimized code.
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on clarity first, then optimize bottlenecks.
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures where appropriate.
- Balance performance with readability and maintainability.
