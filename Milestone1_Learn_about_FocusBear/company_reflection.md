Yes, absolutely. While I haven’t been formally diagnosed with ADHD, I strongly relate to many of its challenges. I often struggle with maintaining focus, initiating tasks, and managing time efficiently, more noticable when studying or working on long-term projects. I tend to rely on last-minute pressure to complete tasks, which isn’t sustainable.

On many days, I get stuck in a cycle of task paralysis , feeling overwhelmed by decisions, fatigued from constant overthinking, and ultimately ending up doing nothing. Digital distractions make it even harder to break out of this state. Focus Bear’s structured approach, distraction-blocking features, and real-time guidance would help me stay organized, improve my workflow, and reduce the mental load of constantly figuring out what to do next.


# We want you to think about this personally not just get AI to write a vague answer. Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?

- While I don’t personally know anyone with ADHD or autism, I do suspect that I might have ADHD, though I haven't undergone a formal diagnosis. I’ve read extensively about ADHD online and also came across a book titled How to ADHD by Jessica McCabe, which resonated with me. Many of the challenges discussed in the book mirrored my own experiences. I do face difficulties in performing well at university, often relying on instinct and pushing through assignments at the last minute. Socially, I've learned to mask my struggles - it's not that I am struggling per se, but I often just get by. Focus Bear could be incredibly helpful for me in organizing my day, reducing the stress of overthinking my next steps, and boosting productivity. Its features, like Focus Mode and the Brain Dump, are perfect for me, helping me stay focused and manage my tasks more effectively.
